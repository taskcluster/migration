# The overall plan for OS X is this:
#
#  * Get all builds, including opt, running in TC at tier 2
#  * Using try or date, green up tests/talos on those builds via BBB
#  * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#    6-12 week beta clock
#  * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of the buildslaves
#  * Using try or date, green up tests using those taskcluster workers
#  * Deploy to the remainder of the buildslaves, converting suite by suite
#    to manage the load across the split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
#
# Tests and Talos travel together here.  Although they may present different
# problems, from the deployment perspective they are the same and share the
# same hardware pool.

        Run tests via BBB on debug builds produced in Taskcluster, immediately
        disabling tests on the builds produced in Buildbot (for capacity
        reasons; potentially disabling those builds soon after).  The tests
        will be converted to run directly via taskcluster-worker later, after
        going to tier 1.

        Once we have debug tests running via BBB, we should do the same for opt tests.
        Note: this will likely entail being more aggresive with switchover decisions for tier 1.

        We learned that SETA is very valuable for managing osx resources and also when we run 
        tasks via buildbotbridge (BBB) buildbot doesn't apply SETA rules. We need to ensure 
        that Taskcluster applies SETA rules for OSX tasks prior to sending them over BBB.

        The startup cache is generated by starting the browser, which is
        impossible in a cross-compilation environment.  This work involves
        determining the impact of simply disabling startup-cache generation,
        and based on that information deciding whether to disable it for
        shipping builds or find a way to generate the startup cache within the
        build process.

        Right now we call `SetFile -a C <path>` to set an HFS+ attribute on the root of the DMG to

        an HFS+ filesystem lying around to run it on, so we'll have to figure something else out.
